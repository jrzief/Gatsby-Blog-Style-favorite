## Decoding Health with Data Science and Machine Learning

### Examining Risk Factors Associated with Early Onset Type 2 Diabetes Among Pima Indian Women

_Motivation_

The impact that diabetes has on patients is severe. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) cite diabetes as the leading cause of **kidney failure, nontramatic limb amputation, and new cases of blindness** in US adults. It is also a major cause of heart disease and stroke. and is also the **7th leading cause of death** in the US (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. National diabetes fact sheet: national estimates and general information on diabetes and pre-diabetes in the United States, 2011. Atlanta, GA: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011).

In addition to the impact on a patient's quality of life, diabetes also imposes a heavy financial burden on patients and our healthcare system. According to the American Diabetes Association, the total cost of this disease in 2012 was 245 billion dollars. 176 billion dollars went to direct medical costs and 69 billion dollars came from productivity losses (DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 36, APRIL 2013). A recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) ranked diabetes first overall in personal healthcare spending compared to other diseases and the costs continue to grow. The study also estimated the rate of spending by disease category between 1996 and 2013 and found diabetes spending growing at a rate of 6% annually (JAMA December 27, 2016 Volume 316, Number 24).

As demonstrated in these reports, diabetes is clearly a significant public health problem that warrants immediate attention from both the public and private sectors. While many medical studies on diabetes care and management exist, the prevalence of diabetes continues to increase as does the cost of diabetes care. Practical solutions are needed to control this disease in order to increase the quality of a patient's life while reducing the cost of care.

Questions raised in this post:

1. What new insights can machine learning provide on how risks vary among different patient types, e.g. younger versus older patients, patients with and without a family history of diabetes?

2. Do diabetes risk factors have a casade effect that escalates the overall risk when several risk factors are present?

3. What are the implications of varying and cascading risks on diabetes monitoring and management guidelines for patient types at risk?

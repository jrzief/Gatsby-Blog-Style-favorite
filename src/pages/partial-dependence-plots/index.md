## Using Partial Dependence Plots in ML to Measure Feature Importance

**Outline**

1. Problem Statement - How can we better understand Cause and Effect between inputs and outputs when using a complex machine learning or deep learning algorithm?

2. Feature Importance - What is Importance? How do we measure it?

3. Linear models

4. Machine learning algorithms
5. Ensembles
6. Neural Networks

7. Partial Dependence Plots i. Linear models ii. Machine learning algorithms iii. Ensembles iv. Neural Networks
